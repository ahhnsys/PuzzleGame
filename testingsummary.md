Testing Summary

**StoryBoard:**
As the Storyboard mainly consists of Android code and images, no tests were implemented for these activities.
Instead, the functions were manually tested through the emulators and on an Android device.
The following have been manually tested:
+ The Moving of an Image through the use of by "holding" a button,
+ The coordinates of an ImageView by touching on it
+ The Intent from one Activity to another through the use of the A button
+ The visibility of Images
